* ## Moderating
  * ### Text
    * Warnings - grounds for official warnings
      * Back-and-forth arguments
    * Bans
  * ### VC
    * Warnings
    * Bans
* ## Promoting
  * ### Discord
    * It is optional to have the server invite link in your bio so that those interested can join the server.
    * One quick way to perform a staff duty is to help advertise our server in the Palia Discord. Please ask a senior staff member to show you how to do so.
  * ### In-Game
    * You are encouraged to invite players in game to join our community! If you pick up a few players while hosting an event or running around, feel free to ask them if they want to join the server. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have them send you a Discord friend request. Then, you can message them the server invite link.
* ## Server Economy
  * ### There are specific items that we manually add to the shop as limited inventory. These items are
    * Ruby
    * Amethyst
    * Sapphire
    * Emerald
    * Aquamarine
    * All Flow Seeds
    * Honey Lures 
    * Unstarred Apple Seed
      * If you have any of these limited items that you would like to offer, you can go to #Economy Inventory and make a post stating what should be added. A Head Staff or Manager will then add it to the inventory. Please make another post if you accidentally give away or destroy one of these items.
* ## Ticket System
  * ### Technical Issues
    * Members may open a ticket for any technical issues they may be experiencing with the server. If it is server related, we can do our best to help them. If it is game related, we can refer them to Palia support.
  * ### Giveaways
    * Members who win a giveaway must open a ticket to claim their prizes. You must have the @Giveaway Givers role to see these tickets (ask a Senior Staff or above for this role).
    * If you choose to claim a ticket, you must coordinate with the member to give them their prizes through the in-game request system.
    * Sometimes, members do not have all four of their requests available. In that case, mark in the ticket thread what the member still needs.
    * When the prizes are fulfilled, make sure you confirm with the member that they have no other questions before closing the ticket. Alternatively, inform them that you will be closing it so it does not come as a surprise to them.
  * ### Reporting A Member
    * Only managers can see these types of tickets. You can refer members to the ticket section if they have a complaint with any other member.
    * If you have issues with any staff member (who is not a manager), feel free to open a ticket so you can communicate with just the managers.
* ## Greeting new members
  * ### Introductions
    * New members are encouraged to introduce themselves by creating a thread in `Visitor Center/Introductions`.
    * All staff are expected to greet new members when they create these introductions.  Some examples:
      * **Simple Greeting:** _"Hi!  Welcome to our community!"_
      * **Staff Sticker:** ![](https://media.tenor.com/N2NrwskmjuIAAAAi/welcome-home.gif)
      * **Engaging:** _"Welcome!  Wow, your puppy is so cute!  How old is he?"_
      * **Reassuring:** _"Welcome!  Don't worry, we are very beginner-friendly and love showing new players the ropes."_
      * **Informative:** _"Welcome!  If you're interested in our events, check out our schedule in the #Events channel."_
        * Staff should engage ***at least 70%*** of new members' introductions.
          * **NOTE:** This is not a hard-set number.  Just do your best 
    * **Introduction Template:** An optional template for new members to use when they aren't sure what to add to an introduction:
      * `TO-DO`
  * ### Meet The Staff
    * When you become staff, a thread will be created for you in our # Meet the Staff channel. An embed will also be created. You will need to write an introduction (you can look at the current introductions for ideas). You will also need to select one image to be used in the embed. You can let a Head Staff or Manager know which picture to use so they can put it into the embed for you.
      * **NOTE:** You __do not__ need to provide an IRL image of yourself.  It can be of your Palia character, your social PFP, or other.
* ## Staff Duties
  * Staff members are newly appointed staff members (less than 1 month)
  * As far as tasks and duties all Senior Staff duties apply (look at senior staff message) but with more leniency towards not fulfilling every point. Take this time as a training period and getting a groove before becoming a full pledged staff member.
  * Head Staff and Senior Staff are your best-friends, they will show you the ropes and answer any question (yes even the stupid ones can and should be asked)
  * The only no leniency requirement is the friendliness and respectfulness across the server. 90% of a staff's job is to upkeep the positive vibes of this community and moderation of VC's and Chats. If we see anything that goes against the community's rules you will have the same treatment of any member: immediate ban or warning.
  * Please understand that even though you have access to moderation functions these should not be usurped. Unless you are 100% sure something goes against our rules do not take any actions without asking first to Senior Staff/Head Staff/Managers.
  * Initial Staff members do not have access to banning function : note that if you ever need to use this function you may contact any higher level staff or for an immediate action you may server deafen and silence members (for example bots or link spamming) and then get someone to ban (in these cases immediately delete the unpermitted content).
  * Being staff does not mean being able to usurp your title: we are all equal and all of us should be treated the same. Same applies to all staff roles: if you see any staff member (may it be Senior, Head or Manager) not following the guidelines or usurping please inform one of the managers immediately.
  * Notes
    * We expect you to be fully committed in being an active staff for the first month that is why longer LoA's (Leave of Absence) are not accepted (no longer than 4-5 days but can be different based on specific individual cases).
    * If this feels like it's not for you at any time you may ask to be retired at any time with no consequence (just the loss of responsibilities and access to staff chats). Note that if you have not become at least Senior Staff you will not receive the Retired Staff role.
* ## Senior Staff duties
  * Senior Staff is a position after the 1 month training period
  * New authorizations in discord commands compared to staff
  * Senior Staff are required to offer support to Head Staff in training new Staff (ex. Bans/Mutes/Rules/Advertising/Introductions/Welcomes/etc....)
  * Senior Staff MUST answer to Introduction messages (a lengthy message is not obligatory but we must set a good example). We don't except every one but at least a good 70%.
  * Senior Staff MUST host at least 1 event per month (can be of any kind even not Palia related)
  * Suggestive feedback
  * Helping with advertisements when possible
  * Moderation of VC's and Chat when an issue occurs (AutoMod already does half of the work in chats but it can ignore some and does not take actions)
  * Assisting players with questions and all around friendliness in general in upkeeping the positive atmosphere
  * Notes
    * Failure to comply with one of these points will result in a warning and be followed up by retirement if no improvements are made.
    * IRL comes first always 100%, if you wish to take a leave of absence at any time you may; just warn Head Staff or Managers first.
    * If you are unable to fulfill the duties for longer periods of times (more than 1 month) you can ask to be retired and can come back when life gets easier.
