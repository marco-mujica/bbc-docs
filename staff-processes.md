1. Moderating
  * Text
    * Warnings
    * Bans
  * VC
    * Warnings
    * Bans
* Promoting
  * Discord
    * It is optional to have the server invite link in your bio so that those interested can join the server.
    * One quick way to perform a staff duty is to help advertise our server in the Palia Discord. Please ask a senior staff member to show you how to do so.
  * In-Game
    * You are encouraged to invite players in game to join our community! If you pick up a few players while hosting an event or running around, feel free to ask them if they want to join the server. The easiest way to accomplish this is to have them send you a Discord friend request. Then, you can message them the server invite link.
* Server Economy
* Ticket System
  * Technical Issues
    * Members may open a ticket for any technical issues they may be experiencing with the server. If it is server related, we can do our best to help them. If it is game related, we can refer them to Palia support.
  * Giveaways
    * Members who win a giveaway must open a ticket to claim their prizes. You must have the @Giveaway Givers role to see these tickets (ask a Senior Staff or above for this role).
    * If you choose to claim a ticket, you must coordinate with the member to give them their prizes through the in-game request system.
    * Sometimes, members do not have all four of their requests available. In that case, mark in the ticket thread what the member still needs.
    * When the prizes are fulfilled, make sure you confirm with the member that they have no other questions before closing the ticket. Alternatively, inform them that you will be closing it so it does not come as a surprise to them.
  * Reporting A Member
    * Only managers can see these types of tickets. You can refer members to the ticket section if they have a complaint with any other member.
    * If you have issues with any staff member (who is not a manager), feel free to open a ticket so you can communicate with just the managers.
* Greeting new members
  * Introductions
    * New members are encouraged to introduce themselves by creating a thread in `Visitor Center/Introductions`.
    * All staff are expected to greet new members when they create these introductions.  Some examples:
      * **Simple Greeting:** _"Hi!  Welcome to our community!"_
      * **Staff Sticker:** ![](https://media.tenor.com/N2NrwskmjuIAAAAi/welcome-home.gif)
      * **Engaging:** _"Welcome!  Wow, your puppy is so cute!  How old is he?"_
      * **Reassuring:** _"Welcome!  Don't worry, we are very beginner-friendly and love showing new players the ropes."_
      * **Informative:** _"Welcome!  If you're interested in our events, check out our schedule in the #Events channel."_
    * Staff should engage ***at least 70%*** of new members' introductions.
      * **NOTE:** This is not a hard-set number.  Just do your best 
    * **Introduction Template:** An optional template for new members to use when they aren't sure what to add to an introduction:
      * `TO-DO`
  * Meet The Staff
  * Social Channel
* Senior Staff additional duties
  * How to train new staff members
